This morning I get up at a half past six oclock. It is still dark. I feel tired. I went to bed at 1 am and did not sleep enough. 
If a person do not sleep eight hours, it is unhealthy, I know. But today I take an exam. 
It starts at 9 am and I have to take a 7-hour bus if I want to arrive on time. 
I am going to take a cold shower, to have a big coffee before getting there.
